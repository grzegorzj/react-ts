I think this sort of actions deserve a Darwin Award, but eh. The whole thing is a workaround for inconveniently designed
API that paginates, but doesn't return the present context (e.g. how many results/pages should I expect), so I have to
fetch another entity to know. Otherwise these two guys would have nothing to do w/ each other, and the component would
decide which actions to dispatch and when (it already would work that way, but I wanted to emphasize that it's the
action, not the component, that should care of making valid API requests).
